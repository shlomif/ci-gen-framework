NAME
====

CI::Gen - A continuous integration scriptology generation framework

SYNOPSIS
========

    $ git clone ...
    $ zef install --force-install .
    $ ci-generate

DESCRIPTION
===========

CI::Gen aims to be a continuous integration scriptology generation framework. Currently it is far from being generic enough.

See https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/23/rub-a-dub-dub/ :

"This stuff went into classes which were not really designed — I simply added methods lazily as I discovered a need for them. (Somewhere, someone with a big stack of 4×6 cards is sharpening their pencil to poke my eyes out. What do you mean you didn’t design your classes?) "
